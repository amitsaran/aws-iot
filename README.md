## What is IOT?
The Internet of things is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines with the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
It is about extending the power of the internet beyond computers and smartphones to a whole range of other things, processes, and environments.
